Skins are custom textures that replace the default ones for a specific class or weapon. Some skins are official and can be obtained through crates, drops, or trading, while others are fan-made and can be downloaded from websites like GameBanana.
 
One type of fan-made skins are the beta skins, which are based on the early versions of the game before it was released. These skins have a different look and feel than the current ones, and some of them have features that were removed or changed in the final game.
 
If you want to try out the beta skins for yourself, you will need to download them from a reliable source and install them manually. Here are the steps to do so:
 
1. Go to [this link](https://gamebanana.com/mods/198857) and download the High-Definition Beta Player Skins mod by Stachekip. This mod contains beta skins for all nine classes, as well as some weapons and items.
2. Extract the zip file to a folder on your computer. You should see a folder called "tf" inside.
3. Go to your Steam library and right-click on Team Fortress 2. Select "Properties" and then "Local Files". Click on "Browse Local Files" to open the game folder.
4. Copy the "tf" folder from the mod and paste it into the game folder. Overwrite any existing files if prompted.
5. Launch Team Fortress 2 and enjoy your new beta skins!

Note: The beta skins will only be visible to you and not to other players. If you want to uninstall them, simply delete the "tf" folder from the game folder and verify the integrity of game files through Steam.
